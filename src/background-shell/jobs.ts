// Pure logic for background shell jobs: wake rules, output buffering, and the
// bounded payload the model actually sees. No child processes and no pi
// runtime here, so every decision below is unit-testable.
//
// The problem this exists to solve: pi's `bash` is fire-and-wait, so a long job
// either blocks the turn for its whole duration or gets backgrounded and then
// POLLED — burning a turn, a slice of a small context window, and thirty
// seconds of local inference to learn that training is still on epoch 3. If a
// fine-tune runs six hours, checking every five minutes is 71 wasted turns.
//
// So the clock is not the trigger. When the model starts a job it declares what
// is worth being woken for, and the harness stays silent until one of those
// things happens. Six hours of progress bars cost nothing; a traceback at
// minute 40 costs one turn, immediately.
